FAILURE 1: **\target\*.war: No such file or directory
Solution: Jenkins is not able to find the the war file baed on the regex matching, we need to specify the full path there to the war file in the Jenkinsfile , for example, /var/jenkins_home/workspace/package_pipelpine/webapp/target/*.war (change it the actual path on your laptop). instead of **\target\*.war 

Failure 2: 'scp' is not recognized as an internal or external command

Failure 3: Store key in cache issue
The server's host key is not cached in the registry. You
have no guarantee that the server is the computer you
think it is.
The server's ssh-ed25519 key fingerprint is:
ssh-ed25519 256 c8:27:c4:b7:e6:64:b0:4a:c1:55:48:c2:b6:62:7a:9a
If you trust this host, enter "y" to add the key to
PuTTY's cache and carry on connecting.
If you want to carry on connecting just once, without
adding the key to the cache, enter "n".
If you do not trust this host, press Return to abandon the
connection.
Store key in cache? (y/n) Connection abandoned.
Lost connection
Solution:

SSH manually to the host, once you connect manually, the first time, then come back to this and try again.

It's just that when SSH connects for the first time, it to asks you "hey, is this valid!?", but the Jenkins job can't respond to that.

Failure 4: Permission Denied
